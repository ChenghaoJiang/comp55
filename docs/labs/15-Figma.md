## Overview
Have you heard of Figma before this class? If so, this lab is for you. 

This lab will be teaching you the simplest core functions of figma to help you create a seamless connected UI across all screens in your Comp 55 Projects.

Figma is a powerful tool to help you line up your ideas before you begin coding them, which is a nice thing to do if you generally like to jump in and begin programming.

Upon completing this lab you will know how to:
- Create a figma project
- Add objects onto your figma project
- Edit object's properties
- Be able to port the design into comp 55

Submission for this lab will be:
// TODO am I even allowed to add submissions in the first place?

## Creating Your Figma Account
To Get Started with this lab, we will assume you've never touched figma before and need to start from the first opening of the website.

Navigate to [Figma](www.figma.com) and then continue.

You'll immediately see a pretty website however we want to just create an account.

Find the button in the upper right corner that says "Get started for free"

I would reccomend just using your school email, so just click on "Continue with Google"

_If you want to use your personal email you can jump to [here](#personal-email)_

#### Google Button
Continuing from before..

Click on your signed in school account.

Then it should take you into your home screen.

Now you have successfully created your Figma account.

[Click here to skip ahead](#finalizing-account)

#### Personal Email

So to create an account using a personal email you will need to just fill in some fields instead of just pressing a few buttons.

You will need to type in your email address and a password for this new account.

I would reccomend to disable the figma emailing list, but that's up to you to keep.

You will be provided with a message sent to that email, in which you will need to click to verify your account.

Go ahead and click it.

After following it your account will be verified and you will need to log in.

#### Finalizing account

About here is where both routes of creating an account come together.

Fill out the forms that are provided

When you get to a step regarding a plan, pick the free one, as most of the premium features aren't needed.

On the final step it will tell you to create a new file, go ahead and decline this.

Make sure to navigate to the home page before moving to the next step.

## Creating Your First Figma Project

At this point if you're inside of a project, go ahead and click on the logo in the top left and then go back to files.

Once you're in the home page you can click on "design file" in the top right.

You will now be inside of your project and can move onto the next step.

## Adding Elements to Project

Now that we are inside of an empty project we can begin adding objects to our board.

### Adding a Frame

Figma's main power is to help you orient objects in reference to the top left corner, which is how ACM orients objects.

To simulate a screen space for our graphics window we will select a frame and then click and drag to create a new frame

Drag this to about 1240 x 1080 so, a standard screen resolution.

### Adding a Rectangle

Inside of the previous frame we can begin adding objects to it.

For this step go ahead and drag the rectangle in at any size you would like.

### Adding a Circle

In an open space click and drag to create a circle as well.

### Adding a Label

Inside of both shapes create a label for both in the same manner.

The tool you will use is the square that has a capital 'T' on it.

Name each label to the corresponding shape.

Highlight the text and then set the text to middle bound, and increase the font size.

## Adjusting Properties

Now that we have some shapes created we can start editing the shapes to make them look different.

### Changing Corners

After clicking on the rectangle you can access the properties on the right-side.

For the corners option you can select the option to the right of the curved line and switch that to 20

You'll immediately be able to see that the rectangle is now nicely rounded as not as sharp.
